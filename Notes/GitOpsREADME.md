# Pull vs Push Model in GitOps (Simple Explanation)

GitOps is a way to manage your infrastructure and applications using **Git as the source of truth**. You store configs and manifests in Git, and automation applies those changes.

## üîÑ Push Model

- **Who applies the changes?**  
  A **centralized CI/CD tool** pushes changes to your cluster.

- **How it works:**  
  1. You make a change in Git.
  2. The CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) detects the change.
  3. It **pushes the update** to the cluster.

- **Example:**  
  Jenkins sees your commit ‚Üí Jenkins pushes the new config to Kubernetes.

- **Analogy:**  
  *A waiter brings food to your table when it's ready.*

## üîÑ Pull Model

- **Who applies the changes?**  
  The **cluster itself (or an agent inside it)** pulls changes from Git.

- **How it works:**  
  1. You make a change in Git.
  2. An operator (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux) in the cluster keeps checking Git.
  3. It **pulls and applies the change** automatically.

- **Example:**  
  ArgoCD sees your commit ‚Üí ArgoCD updates the cluster.

- **Analogy:**  
  *You go to the buffet and serve yourself whenever you‚Äôre ready.*
